Zipcode Weather API

Here is a simple google map API I put together. The experience starts with the user selecting between entering in their zipcode or using the geo location feature supplied in their browser. Once coordinates are provided the API requests go to work and ultimatley provide the user with several thumbnail windows that they can click on to analyze weather information in their area.
